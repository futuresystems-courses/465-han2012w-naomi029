git clone – initialized/downloaded repository
git add – adds files to git staging area; can have multiple files in 
staging area at one time
git commit – records everything in staging area as a single change. When 
a change is committed it stores what was changed, when it was changed, 
and why it was changed.
git push – pushing local changes to remote repository
git pull – pull updates from remote repository to local repository
Remote vs local repository - The local repository is on futuresystems 
while the remote is on the Github server
